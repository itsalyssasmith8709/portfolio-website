                    Hi my name is Alyssa Smith and here are some things about myself!<br>
                    I have been singing ever since I was 6,also I have been doing graphic design ever since I was 13.<br>
                    I started doing graphic design on discord, and I have started singing in a church choir. <br>
                    When i first started doing graphic design i would make banners and sell them on discord for money or game currency or game items.<br>
                    Until one day i had stopped because people stoped buying banners and icons from me. <br>
                    When i first started singing i had sang in my chuch choir and then i gave up on singing ever since i moved to delaware from new york. <br>
                    But once i came to cab calloway and i hear everyone singing in the hallways i got inspied to sing again. <br>
